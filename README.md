# What are Pixels? 

**'Pixel is short for picture element'**

*A pixel is one of the small dots or squares that make up an image on a computer screen, the more pixels there are the more the image looks real or accurate. Any digital image is made up from pixels. Resolution refers to the number of pixels on a screen. Bitmap images are stored as a group of pixels. Each pixel is a small square that is assigned a color, and then arranged in a pattern to form the image. When you zoom in on a bitmap image you can see the individual pixels that make up that image. Light emitting diodes give light as a current passes through them, these individual lights help build up visual meaning and identity.*

The number of colors that can be defined by a pixel depends on the number of bits per pixel (bpp). A 1 bpp image uses 1 bit for each pixel, so each pixel can be either on or off. Each additional bit doubles the number of colors available. This meaning a 2 bpp image can have 4 colors, and a 3 bpp image can have 8 colors:

- 1 bpp, 2 to the power of 1 = 2 colors 

- 2 bpp, 2 to the power of 2 = 4 colors

- 3 bpp, 2 to the power of 3 = 8 colors

- 4 bpp, 2 to the power of 4 = 16 colors

# Pixels build up the visual side of our digital world
*I believe resolution reflects realism to a certain degree, and I found the idea of how pixels being small LEDs build up our digital world through a visual format, A world in which I believe people see for more than a two dimensional screen. With the development of technology I believe the divide between reality and the digital age is becoming less distant, and that social media and technology is no longer respected for its intelligence, but rather just an extension of ourselves and as more of a necessity.*

*Whilst investigating this idea I realised my own lack of knowledge towards these resources we use day in day out and my reliance on tech both educationally and socially. We are all tied together through digital tech in our modern world and how it connects us with most of our personal needs and fulfilment. With some slight investigating into the tech we rely on it has allowed me to appreciate it in a way I could not before and that we should not take the resources we have got for granted.*

*Technology has also provided the accessibility to areas such as social media, and the distorted aspect of reality that these provide us. We as humans have naturally started to believe or think about everything we see on our screens yet this is all virtual as said before adapted and made up then visualised in small lights these being pixels on a screen. This allowed me to think about how different the world would be if we were not always so bombarded by the technical age.*

I tried to reflect this idea visually through combining this distorted visual idea and its relevance to pixels, Knowing I could create a heavy blocked pixelated aesthetic on photoshop I applied this to the message ‘do not believe’, connoting my opinions for a lot of the ideas we are presented with online. The idea that this message written down would only be eligible from a distance which later worked and metaphorically stood out as the idea that ‘things always become clearer when you take a step back’ reflecting my thoughts of how we should approach alot of the stuff we are bombarded with online.

Once this was printed at an A2 scale it reflected itself as just a selection of grayscale squares on a page and looked almost just like an abstract art piece. Once seen from a distance of 40 metres it started to become more eligible, not completely clear but it vaguely reflected the distorted message I was trying to create and reminded me of art works which change as you walk past it with that added layer of meaning.
